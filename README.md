An app for teaching bartenders new cocktails

Current Build:
Cocktails are stored as files in a directory
at runtime:
 A random cocktail is chosen from the directory of cocktail text files
 A text file containing a list of cocktail ingredients is input and stored in the program
 The array of correct ingredients and the array of other ingredients are added together into one single array
 This new array is then checked for duplicates and the duplicates are "removed" (needs updated as ingredients are not actually removed)
 
Two display functions exist:
 1. Displays the correct ingredients and name of the cocktail which the user will later guess
 2. Displays the final array of ingredients which the user will later use to pick from to guess which ingredients are in the correct           cocktail.
